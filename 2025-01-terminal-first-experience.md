# My First Real Experience With the Terminal

## What I Expected

The first time I had to use the terminal was in my Operating Systems class. We were using WSL to access Linux tools and pull basic operating system details and system information. Before that, I had never really used the terminal at all. Most of my experience with computers had been through graphical interfaces, so the terminal to felt like a more complicated way of doing things I could already do visually.

## What Was Hard

What I struggled with most wasn’t typing commands but understanding what the terminal was actually showing me. Commands felt disconnected from the system at first, and it was hard to build a mental model of what was happening behind the scenes. Using WSL added another layer of confusion. I was working inside Linux, but on a Windows machine, and it wasn’t always clear where files lived or how the environments interacted. Without visual feedback, it was easy to feel lost or unsure if I was even looking at the right thing.

## What Clicked

Things started to make more sense once I stopped thinking of the terminal as a separate tool and started seeing it as a direct way of interacting with the operating system. Instead of memorizing commands, I focused on understanding what they acted on like the files, processes, and system information. Realizing that each command was just a specific way of asking the system for information helped reduce the intimidation factor.

## Why This Matters

Learning to use the terminal changed how I think about systems. It made me more aware of what’s happening underneath the interfaces we rely on and why understanding those layers matters when something goes wrong.
For me, this wasn’t about becoming faster or more efficient but it was about being able to understand and support systems directly, especially in situations where graphical tools aren’t available or don’t provide enough detail.

## What I’m Still Thinking About

I still struggle with remembering commands and navigating efficiently without references. But that discomfort has become part of the learning process rather than a blocker. Each time I return to the terminal, especially in Linux environments, I feel more confident interacting directly with the system instead of relying entirely on abstractions.
