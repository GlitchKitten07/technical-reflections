# Technical Reflections

This repository contains short technical reflections written as part of my learning process in computer science.

These are not tutorials or guides. They are notes and explanations written to help me think through systems, usability, security, and reliability in real-world contexts.

The goal of this repo is to practice:
- clear technical communication
- reasoning about tradeoffs and failure modes
- explaining complex ideas in plain language

Posts are written as I learn and may be revised over time.
